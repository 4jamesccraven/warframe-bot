This is a Discord bot designed intended to be used for my server. It is not for general use, though you are free to fork it, provided you follow the rules outlined in the license. I may polish it in the future, but for now it is practical, not pretty.

## Running
At a minimum, the binary this produces requires a valid discord api token to be exposed in the environment as `TOKEN`. e.g.,

```TOKEN=your_token_here wf-bot```

It also expects a `NEWS_CHANNEL_ID` for a channel to which it may post news.
